                <p>
                    A not-so-long time ago in a publishing landscape kinda nearby, in a universe before Kindles spat fire, when epub was a bar in east London and 'mobi' was still a whale, when we carried bound bricks of paper, covers out for everyone on the F Train to see, a time when young girls spinning vampire tales on their blogs had yet to become publishing darlings, before British housewives were unknowingly getting off to Twilight fan fiction, and when we had yet to flip boards, be zite read or book pressed — back in this time, the year of 2010, the iPad emerged and we — Ashley Rawlings and I — ran a Kickstarter campaign to breathe life back into a book called "Art Space Tokyo" and, oh sweet lord, have things changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we ran our Kickstater campaign, raising $25,000 was a pretty big deal. Now if you don't hit $100,000 you're a nobody, and if you don't amass $1,000,000 you're not worth blogging about. Crowdfunding went supernova and digital publishing, too, has shifted from a niche backwater to very soon becoming the way most books are sold.1 While it's easy to see the material changes produced from crowd funding, some of the transitions, foibles and triumphs in publishing might be less obvious.

                        Platforms shape systems — those of production, consumption, distribution — and all critical changes happening in digital books and publishing happen within systems. Post-artifact books and publishing2 is not just about text on screens.

                        As part of our Kickstarter campaign, we promised a digital edition of<strong> "Art Space Tokyo"</strong>. We're finally delivering on that promise today. But more than dump some files in your lap and run off, we want (as we are wont) to fully open the kimono.

                        With an eye towards platforms, let's look back on what has happened in the past two years, and make some sense of how we arrived here.

                    <p>
                        We're publishing the digital edition of "Art Space Tokyo" in several formats, across multiple platforms, within two distinct ecosystems:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            open (the web) 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            and closed (iBooks, Kindle & other ereaders)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
            </div>
            <div class="grid_article">
                <h2>The web </h2>
                <div>
                    <p>"Art Space Tokyo" needed a touchable home. An online, public address for all its content. We gave it just that:<a href="https://read.artspacetokyo.com/"> http://read.artspacetokyo.com </a>. The entire book is there. All the <a href="https://read.artspacetokyo.com/interviews/">interviews</a>, <a href="https://read.artspacetokyo.com/essays/">essays </a>and <a href="https://read.artspacetokyo.com/spaces/">art space </a>information. Everything has an address to which you can point.</p>
                    <p>
                        Why do this? I strongly believe digital books benefit from public endpoints. The current generation of readers (human, not electronic) have formed expectations about sharing text, and if you obstruct their ability to share — to touch — digital text, then your content is as good as<a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/pointable_01/">non-existent</a> . Or, in the least, it's less likely to be engaged.3
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also believe that we will sell more digital and physical copies of "Art Space Tokyo" by having all of the content available online. The number of inbound links to the site should increase exponentially. read.artspacetokyo.com is one of the largest collections of publicly available text about the Tokyo art world online. Organic search traffic should increase accordingly, and by having upsells on every page, the conversion to paid users should follow suit. We'll report back with numbers in time.

                    Just because a collection of text is called a 'book' doesn't mean it can't act like a website. We purposely broke the strict linearity of the physical "Art Space Tokyo". The ambition is to extend the content indefinitely in more organic ways.

                    Our keystone premium product is the <strong><a href="https://prepostbooks.com/physical/artspacetokyo/">physical edition</a></strong> of the book. But we also feel that there is value in buying a 'real' digital edition of a book tied to an ecosystem (or DRM free for you to add it to an independent ecosystem).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example buying a Kindle book directly from Amazon means the text is hooked into all the goodness <em>(note saving, sharing, community highlighting)</em> of the Kindle platform. There is real value in that connection. Value worth paying for and value that carries the promise to become more useful over time.

                    When we announced an 'iPad edition,' we made a very conscious decision not to say 'iPad application.'
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think back: In May 2010, the iPad had just been released. The landscape for publishing on the iPad was nonexistent and we had lots of reservations about books-as-apps as the correct model. It seemed overly complex, especially for a book originally conceived of as a printed object. So at the time we decided to focus on the physical part of the Kickstarter campaign — update, print, and redistribute the clothbound, hardcover edition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It took a few months of full-time work but we shipped the books. They looked great. Our backers were happy. We then spent a month taking all the knowledge gained during the campaign and gave the community a full post-mortem: Kickstartup. Kickstarter even gave us a 'Best in Show: Post-Mortem' award which made us smile.

                    <h2>App what? </h2>
                    <p>
                        Fall of 2010 arrived and the more we looked into developing a custom app for "Art Space Tokyo", the less rational it seemed. Even 'simple' apps are hard. Really hard.5 And whether simple or complex, almost no one was doing it right.
                    </p>
                </div>
                    <p>
                        By this time, several major publishing houses had released magazine applications. Wired, Popular Science, and The New Yorker were among the first few. They were disappointing. The text was images. The file sizes huge. The download process for each issue was awkward. They weren't friendly to screen readers. This certainly didn't feel like the right direction for digital reading, never mind our humble "Art Space Tokyo".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To worsen matters, the navigation was confusing — each application a little different. The clarity of physical magazine usability — 'just keep swiping' — was lost in an effort to 'innovate on' and shoe-horn print workflows into a digital box. The apps just didn't work.

                    In fact, the more we looked at these frankenstinian magazines, the more we realized that a PDF would be a better solution. A PDF would at least be made of 'real text.' It would be inherently searchable. It would compress well. Navigation would be consistent: Just. Keep. Swiping

                            So we began to play with "Art Space Tokyo" as direct-from-InDesign PDFs formatted for portrait and landscape. They worked, sort of. The text was a little small, and they were a bit clunky, but you know what? They offered a better user experience than most of the standalone apps we had seen.

                            Of course, PDFs as a decent way to read on an iPad was hardly a find worth writing about, let alone releasing as the 'iPad edition' of "Art Space Tokyo". I wanted to dig deeper.
