			<h2>The chosen of articles</h2>
			<p>
				I chose these three articles to explore the concept of "gradient" and its evolution and application across different fields. "The Gradient of Color" discusses how color gradients have transformed from mere decorative elements into design tools imbued with emotion and cultural significance. "The Gradient of Style" examines the transition of design styles from complexity to simplicity, showcasing how gradual changes in design language adapt to the needs of different eras. Lastly, "The Gradient of Press" reflects on the shift in publishing mediums from physical to digital, highlighting the evolution of technology and user behavior.

				Although these articles focus on distinct topics, they collectively reveal the deeper meaning of "gradient"â€”not just as a physical transition but as an intersection of design, culture, and technology within the context of time. Through this selection, I aim to illustrate how gradients transcend color, style, and medium to become a powerful symbol connecting the past and future, decoration and expression.
